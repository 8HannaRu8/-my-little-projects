                <p>
                    <span class="logo">Morning Hair Care Salon &#958;</span>  is dedicated to providing our customers with the best possible salon experience.
                    Think about it: Have you ever left a salon feeling like you just weren’t listened to? Or like a stylist didn’t truly “get” your vision? We hate that. Trying a new hairdresser shouldn’t be daunting, and that’s exactly why everything we do at our salon starts with you—our valued customer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At <span class="logo">Morning Hair Care Salon &#958;</span> , we’re in the people business. We strive to make our
                    clients feel comfortable and relaxed, which is why we’ll make you a coffee first and ask questions later. We’re all about chatting comfortably so we can truly understand the specifics of what you’re asking for. If you feel listened to and like we’re your kind of salon, you’ll never have to search for the right hair salon near you again. One of our friendly stylists will take things
                    from there. You can see our full list of salon services <a href="/services.html">here</a>.
